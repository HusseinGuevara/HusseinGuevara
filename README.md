# Hussein Guevara
Hello everyone. My name is Hussein Guevara. I have been a developer for about six months now. I have to say it has really been an interesting journey learning to code. I graduated from a coding boot camp called Coding Dojo. It was truly life changing. Not only did I meet tons of talented, hardworking individuals but I learned an incredible amount of knowledge when it comes to coding. But the most beautiful skill I acquired was how to a self-sufficient programmer and still be able to thrive in a team environment. Besides coding, one of my other passions is music. More specifically, I love to play guitar. I typically revolve around playing Blues and RnB but, just playing the guitar in general I enjoy. Well I cant wait to meet more fellow developers. This is a very exciting new chapter of my life and I cant wait to see what the future has in store.
