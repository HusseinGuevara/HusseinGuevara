### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello everyone. My name is Hussein Guevara. I have been a developer for about six months now. I have to say it has really been an intresting journey learning to code. I graduated from a coding boot camp called Coding Dojo. It was truelly life changing. Not only did I meet tons of talented, hardworking individuls but I learned an incredible amount of knowledge when it comes to coding. But the most beutiful skill I aquired was how to a self-sufficient programmer and still be able to thrive in a team enviorment. Besides coding, one of my other passions is music. More specificlly, I love to play guitar. I typiclly revolve around playing Blues and RnB but, just playing the guitar in general I enjoy. Well I cant wait to meet more fellow developers. This is a very exciting new chapter of my life and I cant wait to see what the future has in store.
